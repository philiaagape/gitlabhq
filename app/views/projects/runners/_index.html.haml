    A 'Runner' is a process which runs a job.
    You can setup as many Runners as you need.
    %br
    Runners can be placed on separate users, servers, and even on your local machine.

  %div
    %ul
      %li
        %span.label.label-success active
        \- Runner is active and can process any new jobs
      %li
        %span.label.label-danger paused
        \- Runner is paused and will not receive any new jobs

%hr
