# Enabling build emails

By enabling this service, you will be able to receive e-mail notifications about
the result status of your builds.

Navigate to the [Integrations page](project_services.md#accessing-the-project-services)
and select the **Builds emails** service to configure it.

In the _Recipients_ area, provide a list of e-mails separated by comma.

Check the _Add pusher_ checkbox if you want the committer to also receive
e-mail notifications about each build's status.

If you enable the _Notify only broken builds_ option, e-mail notifications will
be sent only for failed builds.
